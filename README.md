# Why Compiled Languages ?
This is a very simple experiment to demonstrate the importance of compiled languages over dynamic or interpreted languages when it comes to system programming or high degree of efficiency.


# The Experiment
A simple loop operation to sum up the numbers from 1 to 1,000,000,000 (one billion).

# The execution 

C++ run:
```cplusplus
```

Java run:
```java
```

C# run:
```csharp
```

Python run:
```python
```

Ruby run:
```ruby
```

# The Results
The two figures below show the comparison between `C++`, `C#`, `Java`, `Ruby`, and `Python` languages in terms of speed (time) and memory.
