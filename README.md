# Why Compiled Languages ?
This is a very simple experiment to demonstrate the importance of compiled languages over dynamic or interpreted languages when it comes to system programming or high degree of efficiency.


# The Experiment
A simple loop operation to sum up the numbers from 1 to 1,000,000,000 (one billion).

# The execution 

```cplusplus
```

```java
```

```csharp
```

```python
```

```ruby
```

# The Results
The two figures below shows the comparison between C++, C#, Java, Ruby, and Python languages in terms of speed (time) and memory.
